...As you journey deeper down into the dungeon you begin to wonder if this stair will ever come to an end. Suddenly, just before you were starting to think about going up, the stairs come to an end. Finally! Now it is time to find the treasure room, once done you will be financially secure for the rest of your life. If you now could only find a way to regain some strength so that you can use your bow thne everything should be easier than stealing money from a nobleman...

The glittering of the treasure is so bright that you need to shield your eyes. Such richness! You begin to pack the treasure into your backpack, grinning widely whilst doing so.
